PART I 
 
 Item 1. Business. 
 
 The Company was incorporated in the State of New York on July 22, 1955 and is engaged in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of shock absorption, rate control, and energy storage devices for use in various types of machinery, equipment and structures. In addition to manufacturing and selling existing product lines, the Company continues to develop new and advanced technology products. 
 
 Principal Products 
 
 The Company manufactures and sells a group of very similar products that have many different applications for customers. These similar products are included in one of eight categories; namely, Seismic Dampers, Fluidicshoks , Crane and Industrial Buffers, Self-Adjusting Shock Absorbers, Liquid Die Springs, Vibration Dampers, Machined Springs and Custom Actuators. Custom derivations of all of these products are designed and manufactured for many aerospace and defense applications. The following is a summary of the capabilities and applications for these products. 
 
 Seismic Dampers are designed to mitigate the effects of earthquakes on structures and represent a substantial part of the business of the Company. Fluidicshoks are small, extremely compact shock absorbers with up to 19,200 inch-pound capacities, produced in 12 standard sizes for primary use in the defense, aerospace and commercial industry. Crane and industrial buffers are larger versions of the Fluidicshoks with up to 10,890,000 inch-pound capacities, produced in more than 50 standard sizes for industrial applications on cranes and crane trolleys, truck docks, ladle and ingot cars, ore trolleys and train car stops. Self-adjusting shock absorbers, which include versions of Fluidicshoks and crane and industrial buffers, automatically adjust to different impact conditions, and are designed for high cycle application primarily in heavy industry. Liquid die springs are used as component parts of machinery and equipment used in the manufacture of tools and dies. Vibration dampers are used primarily by the aerospace and defense industries to control the response of electronics and optical systems subjected to air, ship, or spacecraft vibration. Machined springs are precisely controlled mechanical springs manufactured from a variety of materials. These are used primarily for aerospace applications that require custom features that are not possible with conventional wound coil springs. Custom actuators are typically of the gas-charged type, using high pressure, that have custom features not available from other suppliers. These actuators are used for special aerospace and defense applications. 
 
 Distribution 
 
 The Company does not rely on sales representatives in the United States but uses the services of several representatives throughout the rest of the world. Specialized technical sales in custom marketing activities outside the U.S.A. are serviced by these sales representatives, under the direction and with the assistance of the Company's President and in-house technical sales staff. Sales representatives typically have non-exclusive agreements with the Company, which, in most instances, provide for payment of commissions on sales at 5 to 10 of the product's net aggregate selling price. A limited number of distributors also have non-exclusive agreements with the Company to purchase the Company's products for resale purposes. 
 
 Competition 
 
 The Company faces competition on mature aerospace and defense programs which may use more conventional products manufactured under less stringent government specifications. Two foreign companies and two U.S. companies are the Company's main competitors in the production of crane buffers. 
 
 The Company competes directly against two other firms supplying structural damping devices for use in the United States. For structural applications outside of the USA, the Company competes directly with several other firms particularly in Japan and Taiwan. The Company competes with numerous other firms that supply alternative seismic protection technologies. 
 
 Raw Materials and Supplies 
 
 The principal raw materials and supplies used by the Company in the manufacture of its products are provided by numerous U.S. and foreign suppliers. The loss of any one of these would not materially affect the Company's operations. 
 4 

Dependence Upon Major Customers 
 
 The Company is not dependent on any one or a few major customers. Sales to five customers approximated 30 (7 , 6 , 6 , 6 and 5 , respectively) of net sales for 2023. The loss of any or all of these customers, unless the business is replaced by the Company, could result in an adverse effect on the results for the Company. 
 
 Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 
 
 The Company holds 6 patents expiring at different times until the year 2035. 
 
 Terms of Sale 
 
 The Company does not carry significant inventory for rapid delivery to customers, and goods are not normally sold with return rights such as are available for consignment sales. The Company had no inventory out on consignment and there were no consignment sales for the years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022. No extended payment terms are offered. During the year ended May 31, 2023, delivery time after receipt of orders averaged 8 to 10 weeks for the Company's standard products. Due to the volatility of structural and aerospace/defense programs, progress payments are usually required for larger projects using custom designed components of the Company. 
 
 Need for Government Approval of Principal Products or Services 
 
 Contracts between the Company and the federal government or its independent contractors are subject to termination at the election of the federal government. Contracts are generally entered into on a fixed price basis. If the federal government should limit defense spending, these contracts could be reduced or terminated, which management believes would have a materially adverse effect on the Company. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 To accommodate growth and to maintain its presence in current markets, the Company engages in product research and development activities in connection with the design of its products. Occasionally, research and development for products in the aerospace and defense sectors is funded by customers or the federal government. The Company also engages in research testing of its products. For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company expended 1,097,000 and 999,000, respectively, on product research. For the years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022, defense sponsored research and development totaled 581,000 and 334,000, respectively. 
 
 Government Regulation 
 
 Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has had no material effect on the Company, and the Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with such provisions. 
 
 The Company is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act OSHA and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, which establish strict standards for the protection of employees, and impose fines for violations of such standards. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with OSHA provisions and does not anticipate any material corrective expenditures in the near future. The Company currently incurs only moderate costs with respect to disposal of hazardous waste and compliance with OSHA regulations. 
 
 The Company is also subject to regulations relating to production of products for the federal government. These regulations allow for frequent governmental audits of the Company's operations and fairly extensive testing of Company products. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with these regulations and does not anticipate corrective expenditures in the future. 
 
 Employees 
 
 Exclusive of Company sales representatives and distributors, as of May 31, 2023, the Company had 125 employees, including three executive officers. The Company has good relations with its employees.

 Item 2. Properties. 
 
 The Company's production facilities occupy approximately six acres on Tonawanda Island in North Tonawanda, New York and are comprised of four interconnected buildings and two adjacent buildings. The production facilities consist of a small parts plant (approximately 4,400 square feet), a large parts plant (approximately 13,500 square feet), and include a facility of approximately 7,000 square feet comprised of a test facility, storage area, pump area and the Company's general offices. One adjacent building is a 27,000 square foot seismic assembly and test facility. This building contains overhead traveling cranes to allow dampers to be built up to 45 ft. in length. It is also the site of three long bed damper test machines where seismic dampers Taylor Devices manufactures will be tested at maximum force to satisfy customer specifications. Another adjacent building (approximately 2,000 square feet) is used as a training facility. These facilities total more than 54,000 square feet. Adjacent to these facilities, the Company has a remote test facility used for shock testing. This state-of-the-art test facility is 1,200 square feet. The Company owns two additional industrial buildings on nine acres of land in the City of North Tonawanda located 1.4 miles from the Company s headquarters on Tonawanda Island. Total area of the two buildings is 46,000 square feet. One building includes a machine shop containing custom-built machinery for boring, deep-hole drilling and turning of parts. Another is used for painting and packaging parts and completed units. 
 
 The Company's real properties are subject to a negative pledge agreement with its lender, M T Bank. The Company has agreed with the lender that, for so long as the credit facilities with the lender are outstanding, the Company will not sell, lease or mortgage any of its real properties. Additional information regarding the Company's agreement with M T Bank is contained in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, at Capital Resources, Line of Credit and Long-Term Debt. 
 
 The Company believes it carries adequate insurance coverage on its facilities and their contents. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 Taylor Devices Inc. (the Company has been named as a Third-Party Defendant in an action captioned Board of Managers of the 432 Park Condominium, et al. v. 56 th and Park (NY) Owner LLC, et al. Index No. 655617/2021 (S.Ct. N.Y. Co.) (the Action ). 
 The Action was filed on or about September 23, 2021. In an amended Complaint dated April 29, 2022, the Board of Managers of 432 Park Condominium (the Owner ), a condominium association for a high-rise condominium building (the Building located at 432 Park Avenue in New York, N.Y., has asserted a claim against the condominium sponsor, 56 th and Park (NY) Owner LLC (the Sponsor ). The Owner alleges over 1500 identified construction and design defects to the common elements of residential and commercial units at the Building, based upon a report generated by a consultant (SBI Consultants Inc.) retained by the Owner. The alleged defects include, but are not limited to, allegedly-excessive noise and vibration, water leaks and elevator failures. The SBI report allegedly identified defects in the Building s: (a) structural/envelope system; (b) mechanical/electrical plumbing systems; (c) architectural/interiors; and (d) elevators/vertical systems. 
 On March 14, 2022, the Sponsor filed a Third-Party Complaint against LendLease Construction (US) LMB LendLease ), as well as the architects of record on the project (SLCE Architects), the lead structural engineer (Cantor ESA) and the head mechanical engineer (Flack + Kurtz) involved in the Building s design. As to LendLease, the Third-Party Complaint alleges breach of a Construction Management Contract between LendLease and Sponsor and negligence arising from purported failure to perform under the contract. 
 6 

On March 22, 2023, LendLease initiated a Third-Party action against various entities with whom LendLease had contracted for the supply of materials and services in connection with construction of the Building. The Third-Party defendants include the suppliers of products and services relating to the automatic sprinkler system, structural steel, mechanical systems, electrical systems, sheet metal, component assembly, roofing, the building exterior, plumbing, concrete, curtain walls, custom machine work and elevators. The Third-Party Complaint also names the Company as a Third-Party Defendant, based upon a contract between the Company and LendLease to supply 16 Viscous Damping Devices VDDs that were incorporated into a Tuned Mass Damper TMD system designed by another company to limit accelerations of the Building during wind events. On July 5, 2023, the Company timely filed and served an Answer to LendLease s Third-Party Complaint. 
 Additional third-party actions have been filed by parties named as defendants in the Third-Party Complaint. Presently, seven third-party actions are pending. 
 The Progress of the Matter to Date . The matter, and all of the related third-party actions, are pending in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court, New York County before Justice Melissa A. Crane. Justice Crane has appointed Hon. Andrew J. Peck, a retired justice of the Supreme Court, as Special Master to hear and determine disputes regarding all or any part of any discovery issue. 
 On June 13, 2023, Special Master Peck issued an Amended Final Scheduling Order. Among the directives in the Amended Final Scheduling Order is a requirement that: (a) recently-added third-party defendants (including the Company) respond to discovery demands by August 30, 2023 and complete document productions by October 11, 2023; (b) all parties complete fact depositions and fact discovery by March 15, 2024; and (c) all parties complete expert discovery by August 28, 2024. 
 Management Response . Management of the Company vigorously disputes the allegations in the Third-Party Complaint. 
 Based upon the information currently available, there is a credible argument that: (a) the Company met the contractual requirements of the 2013 Purchase Order for Viscous Damping Devices (VDDs) that were incorporated into the Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) system; and (b) the VDDs that were delivered were successfully tested to the applicable specification and met the technical requirements of that specification. 
 The Owner has not itemized the damages it seeks to recover from Sponsor, but the Amended Complaint contains an ad damnum clause demanding 125 million plus punitive damages. Sponsor has not itemized the damages it seeks to recover from LendLease or the other third-party defendants, but the claim for relief in the Third-Party Complaint includes a demand for full indemnification of any amounts the Sponsor is required to pay plaintiff. In turn, LendLease does not itemize the damages it seeks to recover from the several Third-Party defendants (including the Company), but its demand for relief in the Third-Party Complaint includes a demand for full indemnification of any amounts LendLease is required to pay to Sponsor. The Company anticipates that the pending actions would provide opportunities for Sponsor, LendLease and the Company to allocate some or all of any liability to one or more co-defendants or third parties. In view of the limited discovery to date, it is not practical to quantify likely damages to the Company in the event of an unfavorable outcome on liability.

 Dividends 
 
 No cash or stock dividends have been declared during the last two fiscal years. The Company plans to retain cash in the foreseeable future to fund working capital needs. 
 
 Rights Plan 
 
 As of September 25, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to deter coercive or unfair takeover tactics and prevent an acquirer from gaining control of the Company without offering a fair price to shareholders. Under the plan, certain rights Rights were distributed as a dividend on each share of Common Stock (one Right for each share of Common Stock) held as of the close of business on October 2, 2018. Each whole Right entitles the holder, under certain defined conditions, to buy one two-thousandths (1/2000) of a newly issued share of the Company's Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock Series A Preferred Stock at a purchase price of 5.00 per unit of one two-thousandths of a share. Rights attach to and trade with the shares of Common Stock, without being evidenced by a separate certificate. No separate Rights certificates will be issued unless and until the Rights detach from Common Stock and become exercisable for shares of the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 
 The Rights become exercisable to purchase shares of Preferred Stock (or, in certain circumstances, Common Stock) only if (i) a person acquired 15 or more of the Company's Common Stock, or (ii) a person commenced a tender or exchange offer for 10 or more of the Company's Common Stock, or (iii) the Board of Directors determined that the beneficial owner of at least 10 of the Company's Common Stock intended to cause the Company to take certain actions adverse to it and its shareholders or that such ownership would have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Rights Plan will expire on October 5, 2028. 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 A share repurchase agreement with a major broker-dealer, under which the Company repurchased shares of its common stock on the open market, has been terminated by the Company. No shares have been purchased since August 2011.

 Cautionary Statement 
 
 The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. Information in this Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this 10-K that does not consist of historical facts are forward-looking statements. Statements accompanied or qualified by, or containing, words such as may, will, should, believes, expects, intends, plans, projects, estimates, predicts, potential, outlook, forecast, anticipates, presume, assume and optimistic constitute forward-looking statements and, as such, are not a guarantee of future performance. The statements involve factors, risks and uncertainties, the impact or occurrence of which can cause actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in such statements. Risks and uncertainties can include, among others, fluctuations in general business cycles and changing economic conditions; variations in timing and amount of customer orders; changing product demand and industry capacity; increased competition and pricing pressures; advances in technology that can reduce the demand for the Company's products, as well as other factors, many or all of which may be beyond the Company's control. Consequently, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as predictive of future results. The Company disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to the forward-looking statements herein to reflect any change in the Company's expectations with regard thereto, or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The Company's consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are affected by management's application of accounting policies, which are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As discussed below, our financial position or results of operations may be materially affected when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company's financial statements. 
 
 Accounts Receivable 
 
 Our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers is critical to our operating performance and cash flows. Accounts receivable are stated at an amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management provides for probable uncollectible accounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts after considering the age of each receivable and communications with the customers involved. Balances that are collected, for which a credit to a valuation allowance had previously been recorded, result in a current-period reversal of the earlier transaction charging earnings and crediting a valuation allowance. Balances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable in the current period. The actual amount of accounts written off over the five year period ended May 31, 2023 equaled less than 0.3 of sales for that period. The balance of the valuation allowance has increased to 29,000 at May 31, 2023 from 16,000 at May 31, 2022. Management does not expect the valuation allowance to materially change in the next twelve months for the current accounts receivable balance. 
 
 Inventory 
 
 Inventory is stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Average cost approximates first-in, first-out cost. 
 
 Maintenance and other inventory represent stock that is estimated to have a product life-cycle in excess of twelve-months. This stock represents certain items the Company is required to maintain for service of products sold, and items that are generally subject to spontaneous ordering. 
 
 This inventory is particularly sensitive to technical obsolescence in the near term due to its use in industries characterized by the continuous introduction of new product lines, rapid technological advances, and product obsolescence. Therefore, management of the Company has recorded an allowance for potential inventory obsolescence. Based on certain assumptions and judgments made from the information available at that time, we determine the amount in the inventory allowance. If these estimates and related assumptions or the market changes, we may be required to record additional reserves. Historically, actual results have not varied materially from the Company's estimates. There was 322,000 and 772,000 of inventory disposed of during the years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022. The provision for potential inventory obsolescence was 295,000 and zero for the years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 Revenue is recognized when, or as, the Company transfers control of promised products or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring those products or services. 
 10 

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account. A contract s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts which are, therefore, not distinct. Promised goods or services that are immaterial in the context of the contract are not separately assessed as performance obligations. 
 For contracts with customers in which the Company satisfies a promise to the customer to provide a product that has no alternative use to the Company and the Company has enforceable rights to payment for progress completed to date inclusive of profit, the Company satisfies the performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time (generally less than one year), using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material and overhead. Total estimated costs for each of the contracts are estimated based on a combination of historical costs of manufacturing similar products and estimates or quotes from vendors for supplying parts or services towards the completion of the manufacturing process. Adjustments to cost and profit estimates are made periodically due to changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from final contract settlements. These changes may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Any losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress are charged to operations in the period such losses are determined. If total costs calculated upon completion of the manufacturing process in the current period for a contract are more than the estimated total costs at completion used to calculate revenue in a prior period, then the profits in the current period will be lower than if the estimated costs used in the prior period calculation were equal to the actual total costs upon completion. Historically, actual results have not varied materially from the Company's estimates. Other sales to customers are recognized upon shipment to the customer based on contract prices and terms. In the year ended May 31, 2023, 61 of revenue was recorded for contracts in which revenue was recognized over time while 39 was recognized at a point in time. In the year ended May 31, 2022, 60 of revenue was recorded for contracts in which revenue was recognized over time while 40 was recognized at a point in time. 
 For financial statement presentation purposes, the Company nets progress billings against the total costs incurred and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts. The asset, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability, billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, represents billings in excess of revenues recognized. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The provision for income taxes provides for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements regardless of when such taxes are payable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets relate principally to asset valuation allowances such as inventory obsolescence reserves and bad debt reserves and also to liabilities including warranty reserves, accrued vacation, accrued commissions and others. The deferred tax liabilities relate primarily to differences between financial statement and tax depreciation. Deferred taxes are based on tax laws currently enacted with tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered. 
 
 Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income at the time temporary differences become deductible. The Company provides a valuation allowance to the extent that deferred tax assets may not be realized. A valuation allowance has not been recorded against the deferred tax assets since management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are recoverable. The Company considers future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a potential valuation allowance. In future years the Company will need to generate approximately 7.5 million of taxable income in order to realize our deferred tax assets recorded as of May 31, 2023 of 1,583,000. This deferred tax asset balance is 81 707,000) more than at the end of the prior year. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced. If actual results differ from estimated results or if the Company adjusts these assumptions, the Company may need to adjust its deferred tax assets or liabilities, which could impact its effective tax rate. 
 
 The Company's practice is to recognize interest related to income tax matters in interest income / expense and to recognize penalties in selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 
 The Company and its subsidiary file consolidated Federal and State income tax returns. As of May 31, 2023, the Company had State investment tax credit carryforwards of approximately 424,000 expiring through May 2028.

The Company's consolidated results of operations showed a 30 increase in net revenues and an increase in net income of 181 . Revenues recorded in the current period for long-term projects Project(s) were 33 more than the level recorded in the prior year. We had 52 Projects in process during the current period compared with 45 during the same period last year. Revenues recorded in the current period for other-than long-term projects (non-projects) were 26 more than the level recorded in the prior year. The number of Projects in-process fluctuates from period to period. The changes from the prior period to the current period are not necessarily representative of future results. 
 
 Sales of the Company's products are made to three general groups of customers: industrial, structural and aerospace / defense. The Company saw a 27 increase from last year s level in sales to structural customers who were seeking seismic / wind protection for either construction of new buildings and bridges or retrofitting existing buildings and bridges along with a 25 increase in sales to customers in aerospace / defense and an 85 increase in sales to customers using our products in industrial applications. The increase in sales to structural customers is primarily from domestic customers. 
 
 A breakdown of sales to these three general groups of customers, as a percentage of total net revenue for fiscal years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:

The gross profit as a percentage of net revenue of 40 in the current period is nine percentage points greater than the same period of the prior year (31 ). The Company has been able to increase sales prices to recover more of the increased costs for materials and labor that were incurred over the past year. Management continues to work with suppliers to obtain more visibility of conditions affecting their respective markets. These actions combined with benefits from the Company s continuous improvement initiatives and increased volume have helped to improve the gross margin as a percentage of revenue over the prior year. 
 
 At May 31, 2022, we had 135 open sales orders in our backlog with a total sales value of 23.7 million. At May 31, 2023, we had 134 open sales orders in our backlog with a total sales value of 32.5 million. 18.1 million of the current backlog is on Projects already in progress. 7.6 million of the 23.7 million sales order backlog at May 31, 2022 was in progress at that date. 81 of the sales value in the backlog is for aerospace / defense customers compared to 41 at the end of fiscal 2022. As a percentage of the total sales order backlog, orders from structural customers accounted for 15 at May 31, 2023 and 50 at May 31, 2022. The Company expects to recognize revenue for the majority of the backlog during the fiscal year ending May 31, 2024, with the remainder during fiscal year ending May 31, 2025. 
 
 The Company's backlog, revenues, commission expense, gross margins, gross profits, and net income fluctuate from period to period. Total sales in the current period and the changes in the current period compared to the prior period, are not necessarily representative of future results.

 Stock Options 
 
 The Company has stock option plans which provide for the granting of nonqualified or incentive stock options to officers, key employees and non-employee directors. Options granted under the plans are exercisable over a ten-year term. Options not exercised by the end of the term expire. 
 
 The Company measures compensation cost arising from the grant of share-based payments to employees at fair value and recognizes such cost in income over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The Company recognized 417,000 and 201,000 of compensation cost for the years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022. 
 
 The fair value of each stock option grant has been determined using the Black-Scholes model. The model considers assumptions related to exercise price, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and the weighted average expected term of the stock option grants. The Company used a weighted average expected term. Expected volatility assumptions used in the model were based on volatility of the Company's stock price for the thirty-month period immediately preceding the granting of the options. The Company issued stock options in October 2022 and April 2023. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. treasury yield. 
 
 The following assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes model in estimating the fair market value of the Company's stock option grants: 

October 2022 
 
 April 2023 
 
 Risk-free interest rate:

Capital Resources, Line of Credit and Long-Term Debt 
 
 The Company's primary liquidity is dependent upon its working capital needs. These are primarily short-term investments, inventory, accounts receivable, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, accounts payable, accrued expenses and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings. The Company's primary source of liquidity has been operations. 
 
 Capital expenditures for the year ended May 31, 2023 were 3,359,000 compared to 1,392,000 in the prior year. Current year capital expenditures included new manufacturing machinery, testing equipment, upgrades to technology equipment and assembly / test facility improvements. The Company has commitments to make capital expenditures of approximately 107,000 as of May 31, 2023. These capital expenditures will be primarily for new manufacturing and testing equipment. 
 
 The Company has a 10,000,000 bank demand line of credit, with interest payable at the Company's option of 30, 60 or 90 day LIBOR rate plus 2.25 . Interest payable will change from LIBOR rate plus 2.25 to SOFR rate plus 2.365 effective July 1, 2023. There is no outstanding balance at May 31, 2023 or May 31, 2022. The line is secured by a negative pledge of the Company's real and personal property. This line of credit is subject to the usual terms and conditions applied by the bank and is subject to renewal annually. 
 
 The bank is not committed to make loans under this line of credit and no commitment fee is charged.

All of the current inventory is expected to be consumed or sold within twelve months. The level of inventory will fluctuate from time to time due to the stage of completion of the non-project sales orders in progress at the time. 
 
 The Company disposed of approximately 322,000 and 772,000 of obsolete inventory during the years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The Company combines the totals of accounts receivable, the asset CIEB, and the liability BIEC, to determine how much cash the Company will eventually realize from revenue recorded to date. As the accounts receivable figure rises in relation to the other two figures, the Company can anticipate increased cash receipts within the ensuing 30-60 days. 
 
 Accounts receivable of 5,554,000 as of May 31, 2023 includes approximately 24,000 of amounts retained by customers on long-term construction projects. The Company expects to collect all of these amounts, including the retained amounts, during the next twelve months. The number of an average day's sales outstanding in accounts receivable (DSO) was 47 days at May 31, 2023 and 42 days at May 31, 2022. The Company expects to collect the net accounts receivable balance, including the retainage, during the next twelve months. 
 
 The status of the projects in-progress at the end of the current and prior fiscal years have changed in the factors affecting the year-end balances in the asset CIEB, and the liability BIEC:

There are 3 more projects in-process at the end of the current fiscal year as compared with the prior year end and the average value of those projects has increased by 62 between those two dates. 
 
 As noted above, CIEB represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. Whenever possible, the Company negotiates a provision in sales contracts to allow the Company to bill, and collect from the customer, payments in advance of shipments. Unfortunately, provisions such as this are often not possible. The 4,124,000 balance in this account at May 31, 2023 is a 24 increase from the prior year-end. This increase reflects the higher aggregate level of the percentage of completion of these Projects as of the current year end as compared with the Projects in process at the prior year end. Generally, if progress billings are permitted under the terms of a project sales agreement, then the more complete the project is, the more progress billings will be permitted. The Company expects to bill the entire amount during the next twelve months. 46 of the CIEB balance as of the end of the last fiscal quarter, February 28, 2023, was billed to those customers in the current fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2023. The remainder will be billed as the projects progress, in accordance with the terms specified in the various contracts.

The 1,992,000 balance in this account at May 31, 2023 is in comparison to a 1,123,000 balance at the end of the prior year. The balance in this account fluctuates in the same manner and for the same reasons as the account costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, discussed above. Final delivery of product under these contracts is expected to occur during the next twelve months.

Accounts payable, at 1,718,000 as of May 31, 2023, is 20 more than the prior year-end. This increase is normal fluctuation of this account and is not considered to be unusual. The Company expects the current accounts payable amount to be paid during the next twelve months. 
 
 Accrued expenses of 4,078,000 increased 19 from the prior year level of 3,414,000. This increase is due to increases in accrued incentive compensation resulting from increased earnings and sales order bookings, offset by a reduction in customer prepayments. 
 
 Management believes that the Company's cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and borrowing capacity under the bank line of credit will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations and capital improvements for the next twelve months.

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 May 31, 2023 
 25 
 
 [Lumsden McCormick, LLP Letterhead] 

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
 Taylor Devices, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Taylor Devices, Inc. and Subsidiary (the Company) as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition of the Company as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 26 
 
 Cost Estimates for Long-Term Contracts and Related Revenue Recognition 
 
 Description of the Matter 
 
 As more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue over time for long-term contracts as goods are produced. The Company uses costs incurred as the method for determining progress, and revenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin at completion. The process of estimating margin at completion involves estimating the costs to complete production of goods and comparing those costs to the estimated final revenue amount. Long-term contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant variability. Due to the technical performance requirements in many of these contracts, changes to cost estimates could occur, resulting in higher or lower margins when the contracts are completed. 
 
 Given the inherent uncertainty and significant judgments necessary to estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates involved a focused audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment. 
 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 
 Our auditing procedures related to the cost estimates for long-term contracts and related revenue recognition included the following, among others: 
 We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management s methods used to develop its estimates. 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of judgments made and significant assumptions used by management relating to key estimates. 
 We selected a sample of executed contracts to understand the contract, perform an independent assessment of the appropriate timing of revenue recognition, and test the mathematical accuracy of revenue recognized based on costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. 
 We performed inquiries of the Company s project managers and others directly involved with the contracts to evaluate project status and project challenges which may affect total estimated costs to complete. We also observed the project work site when key estimates related to tangible or physical progress of the project. 
 We tested the accuracy and completeness of the data used in developing key estimates, including material, labor, overhead, and sub-contractor costs. 
 We performed retrospective reviews of prior year long-term contracts, comparing actual performance to estimated performance and the related financial statement impact, when evaluating the thoroughness and precision of management s estimation process in previous years. 
 
 Valuation of Inventory 
 
 Description of the Matter 
 
 As of May 31, 2023, the Company s inventory balance was 5.9 million, net of a 68,000 allowance for obsolescence, its maintenance and other inventory balance was 1.0 million, net of an approximate 1.2 million allowance for obsolescence. As discussed in Note 5, maintenance and other inventory represents certain items that are estimated to have a product life-cycle in excess of twelve months the Company is required to maintain for service of products sold and items that are generally subject to spontaneous ordering. The Company evaluates its inventory for obsolescence on an ongoing basis by considering historical usage as well as requirements for future orders. 
 
 Given the inherent uncertainty and significant judgments necessary to estimate potential inventory obsolescence, auditing management s estimates involved a high degree of auditor judgment.

 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 
 Our auditing procedures related to valuation of inventory included the following, among others: 
 We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management s methods used to develop its estimates. 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of judgments made and significant assumptions used by management relating to key estimates. 
 We inquired of management relative to write-offs of inventory during the year. 
 We tested the completeness and accuracy of management s schedule of inventory. 
 We developed an independent expectation of the obsolescence reserve based on our knowledge of the Company s inventory, including analysis of slow-moving items and historical usage and compared it to actual. 
 We examined management s lower of cost or net realizable value analysis and performed procedures to test its completeness and accuracy. 
 We selected a sample of material purchases made during the year to ensure they were included in inventory at the proper value. 
 During our physical inventory observation, we toured the Company s warehouses and examined inventory on hand for any indications of obsolescence.

Less allowance for obsolescence 

Maintenance and other inventory represent stock that is estimated to have a product life-cycle in excess of twelve-months. This stock represents certain items the Company is required to maintain for service of products sold, and items that are generally subject to spontaneous ordering. This inventory is particularly sensitive to technical obsolescence in the near term due to its use in industries characterized by the continuous introduction of new product lines, rapid technological advances and product obsolescence. Therefore, management of the Company has recorded an allowance for potential inventory obsolescence. and of inventory was disposed of during the years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022. The provision for potential inventory obsolescence was and for the years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022.

Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income at the time temporary differences become deductible. The Company provides a valuation allowance to the extent that deferred tax assets may not be realized. A valuation allowance has not been recorded against the deferred tax assets since management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are recoverable. The Company considers future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a potential valuation allowance. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced. The Company will need to generate approximately 7.5 million in taxable income in future years in order to realize the deferred tax assets recorded as of May 31, 2023 of .

in an action captioned . v. . Index No. 655617/2021 (S.Ct. N.Y. Co.) (the Action ). 
 The Action was filed on or about . In an amended Complaint dated April 29, 2022, the Board of Managers of 432 Park Condominium (the Owner ), a condominium association for a high-rise condominium building (the Building located at 432 Park Avenue in New York, N.Y., has asserted a claim against the condominium sponsor, 56 th and Park (NY) Owner LLC (the Sponsor ). . The alleged defects include, but are not limited to, allegedly-excessive noise and vibration, water leaks and elevator failures. The SBI report allegedly identified defects in the Building s: (a) structural/envelope system; (b) mechanical/electrical plumbing systems; (c) architectural/interiors; and (d) elevators/vertical systems.

 The Owner has not itemized the damages it seeks to recover from Sponsor, but the Amended Complaint contains an ad damnum clause demanding 125 million plus punitive damages. Sponsor has not itemized the damages it seeks to recover from LendLease or the other third-party defendants, but the claim for relief in the Third-Party Complaint includes a demand for full indemnification of any amounts the Sponsor is required to pay plaintiff. In turn, LendLease does not itemize the damages it seeks to recover from the several Third-Party defendants (including the Company), but its demand for relief in the Third-Party Complaint includes a demand for full indemnification of any amounts LendLease is required to pay to Sponsor. The Company anticipates that the pending actions would provide opportunities for Sponsor, LendLease and the Company to allocate some or all of any liability to one or more co-defendants or third parties. In view of the limited discovery to date, .
