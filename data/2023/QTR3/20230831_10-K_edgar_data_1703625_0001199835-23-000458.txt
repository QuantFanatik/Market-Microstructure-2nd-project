1. Description of Business 

Overview 

Treasure Shipwreck Recovery, Inc TSR 
or the Company ), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 24, 2016 as Beliss Corp. The Company changed its name
to Treasure Shipwreck Recovery Inc. on June 26, 2019. The Company is in the colonial era treasure shipwreck recovery business operating
salvage crews on the east coast of Florida. 

TSR formed TSR Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary,
on August 22, 2019 as the Company s operating vehicle to focus on the recovery of sunken treasure from historic shipwrecks. The
Company was originally focused on the development of high impact internet marketing, search engine optimization SEO software
and techniques, and the development of digital properties (collectively Internet Marketing ). 

On April 6, 2020, TSR formed TSR Media Group, Inc. TSR Media ), a wholly owned subsidiary, in order to develop various digital media properties. TSR Media is in the process
of developing, through an outside app developer, a treasure search and salvage gaming app. 

Corporate History 

Treasure Shipwreck Recovery, Inc TSR 
or the Company ), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 24, 2016 as Beliss Corp. The Company changed its name
to Treasure Shipwreck Recovery Inc. on June 26, 2019. 

TSR formed TSR Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary,
on August 22, 2019 as the Company s operating vehicle to focus on the recovery of sunken treasure from historic shipwrecks. The
Company was originally focused on the development of high impact internet marketing, search engine optimization SEO software
and techniques, and the development of digital properties (collectively Internet Marketing ). 

Exploration and Salvage of Historic Shipwrecks 

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization UNESCO has estimated that there are as many as three million shipwrecks on the floors of the worlds 
oceans. Although it is a fact that many of these shipwrecks were not carrying any items of significant value, historic research documentation
shows that it is likely that a percentage of these shipwrecks contained valuable artifacts and treasure, such as gold and silver coins,
other precious metals and gems, such as emeralds. 

3 

TSR has contracted with entities for recoveries on
1715 fleet and other or ancient wreck sites along the coast of Florida. Thus far this has been a successful season that will be more updated
in the next quarter. As well as news being released on our social media Facebook page and other arenas. TSR is educating the public and
some 24,000 followers on ancient shipwrecks and recoveries from around the world, and from shipwrecks off of Florida. 

For the 2023 Treasure recovery season, TSR purchased
a treasure recovery vessel and support vessel in March 2023. The 36 foot vessel is outfitted with prop blowers for bottom removal,
and numerous technologies for search and diving. 

For the 2023 Summer Season TSR contracted with entities
for recoveries on 1715 fleet and other or ancient wreck sites along the coast of Florida. Such recovery season was even more successful
than 2021, with precious jewelry, including gold and emerald rings, necklaces, gold, and numerous coins and other artifacts including
large silver items and loose gold. The value of the found artifacts and treasure will be assessed at seasons end. 

TSR is actively pursuing the media coverage opportunities
and expanding its social media presence across the globe with an agreement with a public relations firm that will have the Facebook page,
Twitter account, TikTok account, and numerous other sites that will be interactive for the anticipated millions of followers that we will
seek to gain to follow the story of TSR as it goes forward. During this same time, TSR has acquired media equipment such as drones and
underwater cameras for use in documenting the Company s operations. TSR is actively pursuing a television or other media for a reality
treasure hunting show which is in negotiations presently for production. TSR intends to own such production and rights for sale and distribution. 

The treasure related search and recovery business
is highly specialized and requires special research and recovery capabilities. The industry and opportunity may have significant potential.
For three hundred years, Spain and other European colonial powers pillaged the new world of treasure, shipping riches in thousands of
ships over time back to Europe for the enjoyment and funding of those who never earned it. Along the way, an estimated one out of ten
never made it home. Estimates of lost treasure from these ships in the Caribbean and the coast of Florida alone is conservatively placed
at 60 billion. 

Locating, exploring and salvaging historic shipwrecks
involves a very lengthy and expensive process. It may take several years to successfully locate and salvage treasure or other valuable
artifacts from viable shipwrecks. Moreover, the costs to operate in the historic shipwreck salvage industry can be excessive. These costs
and expenses may exceed the economic value of any treasure that is successfully located. 

Even if TSR is able to successfully locate historic
shipwrecks, there are additional challenges to successfully recovering treasure. There are also various laws and regulations, both internationally
and domestically, that must be complied with. These laws and regulations could further hamper or delay the Company in successfully locating
and recovering treasure. There have been legal cases where shipwrecks were located and valuable treasure was successfully salvaged by
one group only to have government or other private entities assert rights to the treasure. Such a situation could cause extensive delays
in monetizing the treasure due to legal proceedings. There may also be environmental related laws and regulations for the areas where
we conduct shipwreck salvage operations. However, in order to alleviate many of these concerns we are now operating in subcontractor situations
where these permits and grants are in place and TSR is avoiding situations where governments would deny permitting and actions due to
our responsible conduct with our partners on these locations. So therefore, we are not suffering from delays and oversights of other governmental
agencies that are occurring with other treasure related commercial salvage businesses. 

Furthermore, working in an underwater environment
can be hazardous. Difficult weather conditions can significantly delay operations. The condition of wrecks and other natural hazards
can impede salvage efforts for long periods of time, potentially many years in some cases. The maintenance and repair issues with salvage
vessels and equipment can be continuous and very expensive which may lead to excessive down time. 

4 

Even if the Company is able to locate viable shipwrecks
that theoretically may contain valuable treasure, there is the possibility that they may have already been stripped of anything of value.
They may also not have been carrying anything valuable on board at the time that they were lost at sea. It is the Company s intent
to find shipwrecks where available research suggests there were not any previous recovery efforts or past recovery efforts failed or were
not completed. In the event that valuable artifacts are located and recovered, it is possible that the cost of recovery will exceed the
value of the artifacts recovered. It is also possible that other entities, including both private parties and governmental entities, will
assert conflicting claims and challenge the Company s rights to the recovered artifacts. 

Salvage of historic shipwrecks is both very speculative
and risky. Only those investors who do not require liquidity and who can afford the loss of their entire investment should consider an
investment into TSR s securities. Investors should also seek advice from a professional financial adviser before purchasing the
securities of TSR. The Company was able to secure the immediate bridge financing that was necessary for the complete build out of our
vessels, the purchase of state of the art dive equipment, multiple GPS systems that are super accurate, sonar systems as well as detection
devices and the maintenance of capable treasure salvage vessels being used to obtain our goals off the East Coast of Florida primarily
in the Sebastian area. 

Board of Directors 

In October 2021, TSR appointed two additional directors,
being outside directors, Patrick Schneider of West Palm Beach, Florida and Frederick Conte of Las Vegas.

that have included President, COO, EVP, and other top leadership roles managing organizations with up to 2,300 employees, Mr. Conte have

Specialties: Multi-site Operations, Strategic / Operational
Planning, Joint Venture Negotiations, Regulatory Compliance, Sales and Budget Forecasting, Business Expansion, Project Management, SEC
Reporting, Shareholder Relations, Loss Mitigation, P L Management, Turnaround Management, Hypothecations/ Securitizations 

 Treasure Search and Salvage Gaming 

The Company has opened an agreement with cracking
treasure where they are using TSR as the basis for an NFT collection from which TSR entered a licensing agreement allowing Kraken to use
media from TSR as well as videos, on site visits, interviews, and other material provided by TSR for the NFT collection being built by
Kraken. TSR is seeking the build out of a game based on treasure search in an entertaining environment for build out and use as an app
potentially in the metaverse. TSR sees this as a sustainable revenue source for the company going forward. 

Revenue Sources . 

TSR believes that it has numerous potential revenue
routes. Assuming that the Company is able to successfully locate and recover treasure from a historic shipwreck, one revenue opportunity
is to keep many artifacts and treasure as assets, to be shown in a planned TSR museum or public display. Second is sale of treasure and
artifacts through certain auction houses and arranged product sales for coins, etc. Third is private collector sales. Fourth is road show
and museum show fees. Finally, holding rights to television and future gaming revenues from its treasure search and salvage gaming app.
for use on phones and other devices. Although the Company is actively working to develop revenue streams from its core treasure recovery
business and ancillary business opportunities, it is challenging to project when revenues will be realized, if ever. The Company does
expect that sales of some ancient items in the forms of coins, gem stone pieces and shipwreck objects may anticipate generating any revenues
for the foreseeable future from the treasure recovery business or associated businesses via website or other sales. 

Competition 

There are various entities who are working to salvage
historic shipwrecks. There are a few small publicly traded companies and numerous private mostly mom and pop companies,
as well as individuals, who could be considered competitors to locate and salvage treasure from historic shipwrecks. A few of these entities
may have access to financing or greater resources than TSR. The Company is evaluating partnerships and joint ventures that it believes
would be beneficial for financial or strategic reasons with other industry participants. TSR does not see these other ventures as competitive
necessarily except for the fact that if large amounts of gold, silver and jewels are found it could have a liquidity effect on the market
place for sale of such items. As well the media and gaming side of matters gives TSR a different business plan then others who are in
the business. In fact, TSR looks to partner with certain other companies and technologies that are in the treasure business to use such
technologies to define down the actual spots where gold, silver, jewelry and other items can be found using their breakthrough technologies.

3. Legal Proceedings 

The Company is not aware of any pending or threatened
litigation against us. 

On November 9, 2019, the Company filed a declaratory
action in the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court for Pinellas County, Florida for the purpose of obtaining a judicial declaratory judgment as
to the Company s status under the Securities laws as to whether the Company has ever been a Shell Company under the
Securities Laws. Pursuant to Chapter 86 of the Florida Statutes the Court will render a decision whether the Company had ever met the
definition of being a shell company under Rule 405 of the Securities Act, so that all shareholders would be able to utilize Rule 144,
and otherwise be able to enjoy complete ownership and sale of such shares. Such matter is being amended to supply exhibits in a new filing.
With a change in designation from being a shell risk by OTCMarkets, such matter in court was no longer deemed necessary. 

In May of 2023, TSR was sued in county court over
a contract by the firm of Delmar which contends that TSR did not follow through on a contract for their services related to its regulation
A offering in 2022. The Company has defended and is defending such on the basis that Del Mar never performed on its obligations
and therefore was discharged on the contract. Such matter is pending motions by TSR in the county court. Such lawsuit is seeking 20,000
by Delmar.

Market
Information 

Our
common stock is presently quoted on the Pink Sheets under the symbol BLIS , as reflected below, though the current trading
volume is small. No assurance can be given that any market for our common stock will continue in the future or be maintained. If an established
trading market ever develops in the future, the sale of restricted securities (common stock) pursuant to Rule 144
of the Securities and Exchange Commission by members of management, consultants, promissory note holders or others may have a substantial
adverse impact on any such market and the sale of restricted securities by management or others may significantly depress the market
price of the Company s shares. There is currently a limited trading market for our securities on the Pink Sheets. We cannot assure
when and if an active-trading market in our shares will be established, or whether any such market will be sustained or sufficiently
liquid to enable holders of shares of our common stock to liquidate their investment in our company. If an active public market should
develop in the future, the sale of unregistered and restricted securities by current shareholders may potentially have a substantial
negative impact on any such market. The Company s share price is quoted on the Pink Sheets. Accordingly, an investment in our securities
should only be considered by those investors who do not require liquidity and can afford to suffer a total loss of their investment.
An investor should consider consulting with professional advisers before making such an investment. Furthermore, the price of our common
stock may be subject to a very high degree of volatility, which makes owning shares of our common stock highly risky. Shareholders may
find it to be very difficult to deposit our shares into a brokerage account and should consult with a financial advisor before purchasing
TSR s shares. 

Our
stock price fluctuated between 0.06 and 0.01 for the year ended April 30, 2023 and 0.40 and 0.02 for the year ended April 30, 2022.
The price of our shares may fluctuate significantly despite the absence of any apparent reason. In addition, our stock is thinly traded,
leading to even greater volatility. You should expect this volatility to continue into the foreseeable future. 

The
following table reflects the high and low prices of our stock for each quarter during the periods ended April 30, 2023 and 2022:

The
following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a narrative of our financial results and an evaluation of our financial condition
and results of operations. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
A description of our business is discussed in Item 1 of this report, which contains an overview of our business as well as the status
of our ongoing project operations.

Results
of operations 

We
have incurred recurring losses to date. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a
going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 

We
will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other
things, the sale of equity or debt securities. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital.
Based on its historical rate of expenditures, the Company expects to expend its available cash in less than one month from August 31,
2023. 

Summary
of the Year Ended April 30, 2023 Results of Operations Compared to the Year Ended April 30, 2022 Results of Operations 

Revenue 

The
Company recorded revenue of 85,000 and 0 and during the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Revenue is 2023 is due to
TSR granting an exclusive license to use photographic and video rights of TSR s treasure recovery activities for use to publicize
non-fungible token sales as well as appearances by TSR persons for such publication and sales. 

Operating
Expenses 

During
the year ended April 30, 2023, the Company incurred consulting and accounting expense of 148,807, labor expense of 24,218, professional
fees of 75,862, legal fees of 75,363, boat expense of 127,455, research and development of 8,349, general and administrative expense
of 80,054 and depreciation expense of 8,914. 

During
the year ended April 30, 2022, the Company incurred consulting and accounting expense of 119,157, labor expense of 36,924, professional
fees of 80,614, legal fees of 37,545, boat expense of 249,402, research and development of 8,000, general and administrative expense
of 112,598 and depreciation expense of 14,530. 

The decrease in operating expenses
for the year ended April 30, 2023 is attributable to decreased boat expense of 121,947, decreased general and administrative expenses
of 32,544, decreased professional fees of 4,752, decreased labor expense of 12,706 and decreased depreciation of 5,616, which is mainly a result of less exploration activity during the year
ended April 30, 2023. 

Other
Expenses 

Total
other expenses were 477,103 during the year ended April 30, 2023 and 1,140,797 during the year ended April 30, 2022. Other expenses
in 2023 were due to interest expenses. Other expenses in 2022 were due to interest expenses of 774,797 and an impairment loss of 636,000
on the trademark, graphics and related media and product materials that were acquired during the year ended April 30, 2019 and interest
expenses. The interest expense was a result of interest on notes and the amortization of the interest relating to the beneficial conversion
features of several convertible promissory notes. 

Net
Loss 

For
the year ended April 30, 2023 the Company incurred net losses of 941,125 versus net losses of 2,069,567 for the year ended April 30,
2022. The decrease in net loss was attributable to decreased impairment losses, interest expense and operating expenses, as well as licensing
revenue recognized in 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources and Cash Requirements 

Liquidity
and capital resources 

As
at April 30, 2023, our total assets were 368,817. 

As
at April 30, 2023, our current liabilities were 1,167,938 and stockholders deficit was 799,121. 

As
of April 30, 2023, we had a net working capital deficit of 961,216. 

9 

Cash
flows from operating activities 

For
the year ended April 30, 2023 net cash flows used in operating activities was 424,056. 

For
the year ended April 30, 2022 net cash flows used in operating activities was 613,758. 

The
decrease in cash used in operating activities is attributable to revenue and decreased interest and boat expenses. 

Cash
flows from investing activities 

For
the year ended April 30, 2023 net cash flows used in investing activities was 148,225. There were no cash flows from investing activities
for the year ended April 30, 2022. 

The
increase in net cash flows used in investing activities was attributable to the purchase of two additional vessels. 

Cash
flows from financing activities 

For
the year ended April 30, 2023 cash flows provided by financing activities were 732,000. 

For
the year ended April 30, 2022 cash flows provided by financing activities were 463,000. 

The
increase in cash provided by financing activities is attributable to increased proceeds from the sale of common stock. 

We
qualify as a smaller reporting company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions
from certain disclosure requirements. 

For
example, smaller reporting companies are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis under Item 402(b) of Regulation
S-K or the auditor attestation of internal controls over financial reporting. 

Future
Financings 

We
will continue to rely on equity sales of the Company s common shares in order to continue to fund business operations. Issuances
of additional shares will result in dilution to existing shareholders. There is no assurance that the Company will achieve any additional
sales of equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned operations. Future financing activities involving the
sale of common stock under subscription agreements or entering into convertible promissory note agreements may cause substantial dilution
to current shareholders and a significant decline in the price of our stock. 

The
Company may not be able to continue as a going concern. The report of our independent auditors for the years ended April 30, 2023 and
2022 raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent auditors believe, based on our financial
results as of April 30, 2023, that such results raised substantial doubts about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
If the Company is not able to continue as a going concern, it is highly likely that all capital invested in the Company will be lost. 

Management
believes that current trends toward lower capital investment in start-up companies pose the most significant challenge to the Company s
success over the next year and in future years. Additionally, the Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting
requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Company s management will have to spend additional time on
policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement
its business plan and impede the speed of its operations. 

Limited
operating history; need for additional capital 

There
is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in a start-up stage of operations
and have generated very negligible revenues since inception. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations.
Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and
possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on
the consolidated financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting
pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the
Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

 Treasure
 Shipwreck Recovery, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Treasure Shipwreck Recovery, Inc. (the Company) as of April 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended April 30, 2023, and the
related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended April 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. 

Substantial Doubt about the Company s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2, the Company has incurred
net losses and negative cash flow from operations since inception. These factors, and the need for additional financing in order for the
Company to meet its business plans raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion
is not modified with respect to that matter. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements
based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were
we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated
below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated
to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved
our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our
opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Revenue Recognition 

As described in Note 3 to the
Company s consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, including licensing
revenue. To determine whether the Company s promise to provide a right to access its intellectual property or a right to use
its intellectual property, the Company considers the nature of the intellectual property to which the customer will have rights. 

We identified the Company s application
of revenue recognition as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination of this critical audit matter related
to the high degree of subjectivity in the Company s judgments in determining the qualitative factors. Auditing these judgments and
assumptions by the Company involves auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these
matters. 

The primary procedures we performed to address
these critical audit matters included the following: 

We obtained the licensing agreement and management s assessment of ASC 606 and performed the following
procedures: 

- Reviewed the licensing agreement for relevant terms. 

- Reviewed management s assessment and conclusion of ASC 606 in relation to
the licensing agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management s application of their accounting policies in the determination
of the revenue to be recognized. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since
2019.

Note
2 GOING CONCERN 

These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will be able to realize its
assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred net losses
since inception, which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on its historical
rate of expenditures, the Company expects to expend its available cash in less than one month from August 31, 2023. Management s
plans include raising capital through the equity markets to fund operations and, eventually, the generation of revenue through its business.
The Company does not expect to generate any significant revenues for the foreseeable future. At April 30, 2023, the Company had a net
working capital deficit of 961,216. The Company is in immediate need of further working capital and is seeking options, with respect
to financing, in the form of debt, equity or a combination thereof. 

Failure
to raise adequate capital and generate adequate revenues could result in the Company having to curtail or cease operations. The Company s
ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. Additionally, even if the Company does raise
sufficient capital to support its operating expenses and generate adequate revenues, there can be no assurances that the revenue will
be sufficient to enable it to develop to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows from operations. These matters raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern; however, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have
been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course
of business. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or
the classifications of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis
of Presentation 

This
summary of significant accounting policies of TSR is presented to assist in understanding the Company s consolidated financial
statements. The consolidated financial statements and notes are representations of the Company s management, who are responsible
for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America GAAP and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The Company s
year-end is April 30. 

F- 8 

Principles
of Consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of TSR Holdings, Inc. and TSR Media Group, Inc., which are wholly
owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
process of preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding
certain types of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Significant estimates for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022 include
the useful life of property and equipment, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and fair value of non cash equity transactions. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

There
were no cash equivalents at April 30, 2023 and 2022. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit
risk consist principally of cash deposits. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC up to 250,000. As of April 30, 2023, the Company had 0 in excess of the FDIC insured limit. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Expenditures
for research and development are expensed as incurred. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with
Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of ASC 606
is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity recognizes revenue in accordance
with that core principle by applying the following steps: Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer, Step 2: Identify the performance
obligations in the contract, Step 3: Determine the transaction price, Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations
in the contract and Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Specifically, Section 606-10-50
requires an entity to provide information about: a. Revenue recognized from contracts with customers, including the disaggregation of
revenue into appropriate categories; b. Contract balances, including the opening and closing balances of receivables, contract assets,
and contract liabilities; c. Performance obligations, including when the entity typically satisfies its performance obligations and the
transaction price that is allocated to the remaining performance obligations in a contract; and d. Significant judgments, and changes
in judgments, made in applying the requirements to those contracts. 

The Company offers no discounts,
rebates, rights of return, or other allowances to clients which would result in the establishment of reserves against service revenue.
Additionally, to date, the Company has not incurred incremental costs in obtaining a client contract. 

Licensing
Revenue 

The Company recognizes licensing
revenue under ASC 606-10-55-59 . In order to determine whether the Company s promise to provide a right
to access or to use its intellectual property, the Company should consider the nature of the intellectual property to which the customer
will have rights. Intellectual property is either: 

a. Functional intellectual property. Intellectual property that has significant standalone functionality
(for example, the ability to process a transaction, perform a function or task, or be played or aired). Functional intellectual property
derives a substantial portion of its utility (that is, its ability to provide benefit or value) from its significant standalone functionality. 

b. Symbolic intellectual property. Intellectual property that is not functional intellectual property (that
is, intellectual property that does not have significant standalone functionality). Because symbolic intellectual property does not have
significant standalone functionality, substantially all of the utility of symbolic intellectual property is derived from its association
with the entity s past or ongoing activities, including its ordinary business activities. 

Intellectual
property that has significant standalone functionality is functional IP. Functional IP is a right to use IP because the IP has standalone
functionality and the customer can use the IP as it exists at a point in time. 

F- 9 

All of the Company s revenue in 2023 consists of revenue pursuant to a Media
Use and License Agreement, which was determined to be Functional IP. 

Basic
Loss per Share 

The
Company has adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ASC 260-10, which provides for the calculation of basic 
and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income or
loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect
the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity. 

The
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022 were excluded from the dilutive loss per
share calculation as they would be antidilutive due to the net loss. As of April 30, 2023 and 2022, there were approximately
16,322,590 and 10,400,923 shares of common stock underlying our outstanding convertible notes payable and warrants,
respectively. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

The
carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts payable, short term loans, and the Company s related
party convertible loan from a shareholder approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

Fixed
Assets 

Fixed
assets are recorded at historical cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective
assets. Gains and losses upon disposition are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the period of disposition. Maintenance
and repair expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. Currently the Company s only assets are three diving vessels and a
magnetometer. They are being depreciated over three to twelve year useful lives. 

Impairment
of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets 

Long-lived
assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable.
The Company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment. When impairment
indicators exist, the Company uses market quotes, if available or an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related
asset or asset group over the remaining life in measuring whether or not the asset values are recoverable. Identified intangible assets
are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not
be recoverable. 

During the year ended 
April 30, 2022, the Company recognized an impairment loss of 636,000 on the trademark, graphics and related media and product
materials that were acquired during the year ended April 30, 2019. 

Stock
Based Compensation to Employees and Service Providers 

The
Company recognizes all share-based payments to employees and service providers, including grants of employee stock options, as compensation
expense in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values. That expense will be recognized over the period during which
an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period)
or immediately if the share-based payments vest immediately. 

F- 10 

Convertible
Notes Payable 

The
Company accounts for convertible notes deemed conventional and conversion options embedded in non-conventional convertible notes which
qualify as equity under ASC 815, in accordance with the provisions of ASC 470-20, which provides guidance on accounting for convertible
securities with beneficial conversion features. ASC 470-10 addresses classification determination for specific obligations, such as short-term
obligations expected to be refinanced on a long-term basis, due-on-demand loan arrangements, callable debt, sales of future revenue,
increasing rate debt, debt that includes covenants, revolving credit agreements subject to lock-box arrangements and subjective acceleration
clauses. Accordingly, the Company records, as a discount to convertible notes, the intrinsic value of such conversion options based upon
the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective
conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt. 

Customer
Deposits 

Customer
deposits discloses an amount paid by a customer prior to the Company providing it with goods or services. The Company has an obligation
to provide the goods or services to the customer or to return the money. The Company had 8,700 in customer deposits as of April 30,
2023 and 2022. 

Income
Taxes 

Income
taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using
the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available
evidence, are not expected to be realized. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

All
other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on
the Company s present or future consolidated financial statements.

Note
5 PURCHASE OF TRADEMARK, GRAPHICS, RELATED MEDIA AND PRODUCT MATERIALS 

The
Company entered into a Trademark and Usage Purchase Agreement with Galleon Quest, LLC GQ ), a privately held limited liability
company, on March 5, 2020. 

Under
the terms of the Trademark and Usage Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 1,200,000 shares of its restricted common stock
to GQ in exchange for the acquisition of a registered trademark and all other developed graphics, including for gaming, web site and
all other material for television, multimedia, gaming, food and products such as beverages, and all other issues. In addition, the Company
agreed that GQ shall retain the right to ten percent of the gaming rights and five percent of the television media revenue, which shall
be for rights of the gaming name rights, as used in all app, online or other gaming as owned by TSR and any television related media.
All shares issued by both parties under the agreement have all rights and entitlements as the common stock of every other shareholder
of such share class. 

The
purchase of the trademark and related graphics and materials was valued at 636,000 based on fair value of TSR s shares on the
date of the Trademark and Usage Purchase Agreement. During the year ended April 30, 2022, the Company wrote down the balance to 0 and
recorded an impairment loss of 636,000. 

Note
6 NOTES PAYABLE AND CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE 

Related
Party Convertible Loan 

An
officer of the Company has provided a loan to TSR under a convertible promissory note. This convertible promissory note is unsecured,
non-interest bearing, and is convertible into common shares of the Company stock at 2.75 per share and due on demand. The balance due
to the officer was 60,890 and 53,890 as of April 30 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

On
April 20, 2022, the Company entered into a convertible note payable with an individual who is a member of the Company s Board of
Directors. The note payable, with a face value of 50,000, bears interest at 10.0 per annum and is due on July 21, 2023. The convertible
note payable is convertible upon default, at the note holder s option, into the Company s common shares at a fixed conversion
rate of 0.05. The conversion of the note into shares of the Company s common stock is potentially highly dilutive to current shareholders.
If the note holder elects to sell the shares that it has acquired as a result of converting the note into shares of common stock, then
any such sales may result in a significant decrease in the market price of the Company s shares. This convertible promissory note
is currently in default due to non payment of principal and interest. 

Short
Term Loans 

As
of April 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had loans totaling 2,700 and 16,763 with two non-related parties, a loan in the amount of 14,063
and a loan in the amount of 2,700. These loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. The 14,063 loan was converted
to stock during the year ended April 30, 2023.

Note
8 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

Litigation 

During the normal course of business, the Company
may be exposed to litigation. When the Company becomes aware of potential litigation, it evaluates the merits of the case in accordance
with FASB ASC 450-20-50, Contingencies. The Company evaluates its exposure to the matter, possible legal or settlement strategies
and the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome. If the Company determines that an unfavorable outcome is probable and can be reasonably

has agreed to pay to the consultant shares of its restricted common stock for successfully locating treasure. 

Note
9 INCOME TAXES 

The
Company adopted the provisions of uncertain tax positions as addressed in ASC 740-10-65-1. As a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10-65-1,
the Company recognized no increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. 

The
Company has no tax position at April 30, 2023 for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty
about the timing of such deductibility. The Company does not recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest
expense and penalties in operating expenses. No such interest or penalties were recognized during the period presented. The Company had
no accruals for interest and penalties at April 30, 2023. The Company s utilization of any net operating loss carry forward may
be unlikely as a result of its intended activities. 

F- 15 

The
valuation allowance at April 30, 2023 and 2022 was 897,872 and 700,236, respectively. The net change in valuation allowance during
the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022 were 197,636 and 434,609, respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax
assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not
be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during
the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income
tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of
these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset
balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of April 30, 2023 and 2022. All tax years since inception
remains open for examination only by taxing authorities.

The
Company has a net operating loss carryforward for tax purposes totaling 4,275,583 at April 30, 2023, expiring through 2035. There is
a limitation on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by carryforwards after a change in control (generally greater than a
50 change in ownership). Temporary differences, which give rise to a net deferred tax asset, are as follows:

Note
10 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

An
officer of the Company has provided a loan to TSR under a convertible promissory note. This convertible promissory note is unsecured,
non-interest bearing, and is convertible into common shares of the Company stock at 2.75 per share and due on demand. The balance due
to the officer was 60,890 and 53,890 as of April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

On
April 20, 2022, the Company entered into a convertible note payable with an individual who is a member of the Company s Board of
Directors. The note payable, with a face value of 50,000, bears interest at 10.0 per annum and is due on July 21, 2022. The convertible
note payable is convertible upon default, at the note holder s option, into the Company s common shares at a fixed conversation
rate of 0.05. The conversion of the note into shares of the Company s common stock is potentially highly dilutive to current shareholders.
If the note holder elects to sell the shares that it has acquired as a result of converting the note into shares of common stock, then
any such sales may result in a significant decrease in the market price of the Company s shares. This convertible promissory note
is currently in default due to non payment of principal and interest. 

During the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, the
Company paid its President 93,350 and 53,970, respectively, for services provided which are included in operating expenses in the consolidated
statements of operations. 

Note
11 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

Subsequent
to April 30, 2023 the Company issued the following shares of common stock: 

(i) 
 6,502,529 shares
to settle a total of 195,076 of the principal balances and accrued interest of three convertible notes payable; and

(a)
Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

Management s
Responsibility for Controls and Procedures 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company s financial
reporting. The Company s controls over financial reporting are designed under the supervision of the Company s President
and Principal Financial Officer to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files
or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is accumulated and communicated to
the Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our President and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under
the Exchange Act, as of April 30, 2023. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our financial disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective so as to timely record, process, summarize and report financial information required to be included on our Securities
and Exchange Commission SEC reports due to the Company s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have
multiple levels of transaction review. However, as a result of our evaluation and review process, management believes that the financial
statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct. 

Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

As
of April 30, 2023, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operations of our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and based on the criteria for effective internal control described in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (as revised). Based on our evaluation,
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective so as to timely record, process, summarize
and report financial information required to be included on our SEC reports due to the Company s limited internal resources and
lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review. However, as a result of our evaluation and review process, management
believes that the financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct. 

The
management including its Principal Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures,
or its internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design
of the control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. 

Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 

The
Company has limited resources and as a result, a material weakness in financial reporting currently exists, because of our limited resources
and personnel, including those described below. 

The
Company has an insufficient quantity of dedicated resources and experienced personnel involved in reviewing and designing internal controls.
As a result, a material misstatement of the interim and annual financial statements could occur and not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. 

We
have not achieved the optimal level of segregation of duties relative to key financial reporting functions. 

We
do not have an audit committee or an independent audit committee financial expert. While not being legally obligated to have an audit
committee or independent audit committee financial expert, it is management s view that to have an audit committee, comprised of
independent board members, and an independent audit committee financial expert is an important entity-level control over the Company s
financial statements. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency (within the meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) auditing standard 5) or
combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management
has determined that a material weakness exists due to a lack of segregation of duties, resulting from the Company s limited resources
and personnel. 

12 

Remediation
Efforts to Address Deficiencies in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

As
a result of these findings, management, upon obtaining sufficient capital and operations, intends to take practical, cost-effective steps
in implementing internal controls, including the possible remedial measures set forth below. As of April 30, 2023, we did not have sufficient
capital and/or operations to implement any of the remedial measures described below. 

Assessing
the current duties of existing personnel and consultants, assigning additional duties to existing personnel and consultants, and, in
a cost effective manner, potentially hiring additional personnel to assist with the preparation of the Company s financial statements
to allow for proper segregation of duties, as well as additional resources for control documentation. 

Assessing
the duties of the existing officers of the Company and, in a cost effective manner, possibly promote or hire additional personnel to
diversify duties and responsibilities of such executive officers. 

Board
to review and make recommendations to shareholders concerning the composition of the Board of Directors, with particular focus on issues
of independence. The Board of Directors will consider nominating an audit committee and audit committee financial expert, which may or
may not consist of independent members. 

Interviewing
and potentially hiring outside consultants that are experts in designing internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO (as revised). 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules
of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report.

Corporate
Governance 

The
Company does not have a compensation committee and it does not have an audit committee financial expert. It does not have a compensation
committee because its Board of Directors consists of only one director whom is not independent, as he is also an officer. There is no
independent audit committee financial expert because it is believed the cost related to retaining a financial expert at this time is
prohibitive due to the current circumstances of the Company. Further, because there are only minimal operations at the present time,
it is believed the services of a financial expert are not warranted. 

Conflicts
of Interest 

The
Company does not currently foresee any conflict of interest. 

Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 

16(a)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the company directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than ten percent

to furnish the company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. The Company intends to ensure to the best of its ability that

with in a timely fashion.
