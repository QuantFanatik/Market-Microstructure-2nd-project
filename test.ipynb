    "CVR Partners, LP (referred to as CVR Partners or the Partnership) is a Delaware limited partnership formed in 2011 by CVR Energy, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, but excluding the Partnership and its subsidiaries, CVR Energy) to own, operate and grow its nitrogen fertilizer business. The Partnership produces nitrogen fertilizer products at two manufacturing facilities, one located in Coffeyville, Kansas operated by our wholly owned subsidiary, Coffeyville Resources Nitrogen Fertilizers, LLC (CRNF or the Coffeyville Facility) and one located in East Dubuque, Illinois operated by our wholly owned subsidiary, East Dubuque Nitrogen Fertilizers, LLC (EDNF or the East Dubuque Facility). Both facilities manufacture ammonia and are able to further upgrade such ammonia to other nitrogen fertilizer products, principally urea ammonium nitrate (UAN). Nitrogen fertilizer is used by farmers to improve the yield and quality of their crops, primarily corn and wheat. The Partnership’s products are sold on a wholesale basis in the United States. As used in these financial statements, references to CVR Partners, the Partnership, we, us, and our may refer to consolidated subsidiaries of CVR Partners or one or both of the facilities, as the context may require.\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizational Structure and Related Ownership\n",
    "\n",
    "The following chart illustrates the organizational structure of the Partnership as of December 31, 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "Facilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Coffeyville Facility - We own and operate a nitrogen fertilizer production facility in Coffeyville, Kansas that includes a gasifier complex having a capacity of 89 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen, a 1,300 ton per day capacity ammonia unit and a 3,100 ton per day capacity UAN unit. The Coffeyville Facility is the only nitrogen fertilizer plant in North America that utilizes a pet coke gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer. The Coffeyville Facility’s largest raw material cost used in the production of ammonia is pet coke, which it purchases from CVR Energy and third parties. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Partnership purchased approximately 22.5 million, 23.0 million, and 18.4 million, respectively, of pet coke, which equaled an average cost per ton of 52.88, 44.69, and 35.25, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we upgraded approximately 94%, 87%, and 87%, respectively, of our ammonia production into UAN, a product that generated greater profit per ton than ammonia for both 2022 and 2021, but not for 2020. When the economics are favorable, we expect to continue upgrading substantially all of our ammonia production into UAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "East Dubuque Facility - We own and operate a nitrogen fertilizer production facility in East Dubuque, Illinois that includes a 1,075 ton per day capacity ammonia unit and a 950 ton per day capacity UAN unit. The East Dubuque Facility has the flexibility to vary its product mix, thereby enabling it to upgrade a portion of its ammonia production into varying amounts of UAN, nitric acid, and liquid and granulated urea, depending on market demand, pricing, and storage availability. The East Dubuque Facility’s largest raw material cost used in the production of ammonia is natural gas, which it purchases from third parties. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the East Dubuque Facility incurred approximately 46.0 million, 31.8 million, and 19.9 million for feedstock natural gas used in production, respectively, which equaled an average cost of 6.66, 3.95, and 2.31 per MMBtu, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commodities\n",
    "\n",
    "The nitrogen products we produce are globally traded commodities and are subject to price competition. The customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on customer service and product quality. The selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions, feedstock costs, and changes in supply and demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agriculture\n",
    "\n",
    "Nutrients are depleted in soil over time and, therefore, must be replenished through fertilizer application. Nitrogen is the most quickly depleted nutrient and must be replenished every year, whereas phosphate and potassium can be retained in soil for up to three years. Plants require nitrogen in the largest amounts, and it accounts for approximately 56% of primary fertilizer consumption on a nutrient ton basis, per the International Fertilizer Association (IFA).\n",
    "\n",
    "The three primary forms of nitrogen fertilizer used in the United States are ammonia, urea, and UAN. Unlike ammonia and urea, UAN can be applied throughout the growing season and can be applied in tandem with pesticides and herbicides, providing farmers with flexibility and cost savings. As a result of these factors, UAN typically commands a premium price to urea and ammonia, on a nitrogen equivalent basis. However, during 2020, UAN commanded a discount price to urea and premium to ammonia, on a nitrogen equivalent basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Demand\n",
    "\n",
    "Global demand for fertilizers is driven primarily by grain demand and prices, which, in turn, are driven by population growth, farmland per capita, dietary changes in the developing world, and increased consumption of bio-fuels. According to the IFA, from 1976 to 2020, global fertilizer demand grew 2% annually. Global fertilizer use, consisting of nitrogen, phosphate, and potash, is projected to increase by 3% through 2023 to meet global food demand according to a study funded by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. Currently, the developed world uses fertilizer more intensively than the developing world, but sustained economic growth in emerging markets is increasing food demand and fertilizer use. In addition, populations in developing countries are shifting to more protein-rich diets as their incomes increase, with such consumption requiring more grain for animal feed. As an example, China’s wheat and coarse grains production is estimated to have increased 40% between 2011 and 2022, but still failed to keep pace with increases in demand, prompting China to grow its wheat and coarse grain imports by more than 1,307% over the same period, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n",
    "\n",
    "The United States is the world’s largest exporter and producer of coarse grains, accounting for 24% of world exports and 25% of world production for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, according to the USDA. A substantial amount of nitrogen is consumed in production of these crops to increase yield. Based on Fertecon Limited’s Fertecon 2022 estimates, the United States is the world’s third largest consumer and importer of nitrogen fertilizer. Fertecon is an agency which provides market information and analysis on fertilizers and fertilizer raw materials for fertilizer and related industries, as well as international agencies. Fertecon estimates indicate that the United States represented 11% of total global nitrogen fertilizer consumption for 2022, with China and India as the top consumers representing 22% and 17% of total global nitrogen fertilizer consumption, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "North American nitrogen fertilizer producers predominantly use natural gas as their primary feedstock. Over the last five years, U.S. oil and natural gas reserves have increased significantly due to, among other factors, advances in extracting shale oil and gas, as well as relatively high oil and gas prices. During February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, tightening global supply conditions for nitrogen fertilizers as economies began to recover from the global COVID-19 pandemic. Following the invasion of Ukraine, Russia also began restricting supplies of natural gas to Europe in response to European sanctions against Russia. As a result, costs for natural gas as a feedstock in Europe increased significantly and caused multiple fertilizer plant shut-ins. Certain European countries also curtailed industrial natural gas usage, resulting in deteriorated economics for producing fertilizers in the region. In addition, China and Russia restricted exports of fertilizers for much of 2022 in order to ensure domestic availability. In North America, natural gas prices also increased throughout 2022, but decreased in January 2023. However, higher nitrogen fertilizer prices more than offset the rise in natural gas costs throughout 2022. As a result, North America continues to be a low-cost region for nitrogen fertilizer production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw Material Supply\n",
    "\n",
    "Coffeyville Facility - During the past five years, approximately 44% of the Coffeyville Facility’s pet coke requirements, on average, were supplied by CVR Energy’s adjacent Coffeyville, Kansas refinery pursuant to a supply agreement between one of our subsidiaries and a subsidiary of CVR Energy (the Coffeyville MSA). Historically, our Coffeyville Facility has obtained the remainder of its pet coke requirements through third-party contracts typically priced at a discount to the spot market. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, our supply of pet coke from the Coffeyville refinery was approximately 47%, 43%, and 33%, respectively. We have contracts with several vendors to supply third-party pet coke, which could be delivered by truck, railcar, or barge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, our Coffeyville Facility relies on a third-party air separation plant at its location that provides contract volumes of oxygen, nitrogen, and compressed dry air to the Coffeyville Facility gasifiers. The reliability of the air separation plant can have a significant impact on our Coffeyville Facility’s operations. In 2020, we executed a new product supply agreement that obligates the counterparty to invest funds to upgrade its facility to reduce downtime over the next several years. Should the oxygen volume fall below a specified level, the on-site vendor is contractually obligated to provide excess oxygen through its own mechanism or through third-party purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "East Dubuque Facility - Our East Dubuque Facility uses natural gas to produce nitrogen fertilizer. Our East Dubuque Facility is generally able to purchase natural gas at competitive prices due to its connection to the Northern Natural Gas interstate pipeline system, which is within one mile of the facility, and a third-party owned and operated pipeline. The pipelines are connected to a third-party distribution system at the Chicago Citygate receipt point and at the Hampshire interconnect from which natural gas is transported to our East Dubuque Facility. As of December 31, 2022, we had commitments to purchase approximately 0.7 million and 0.6 million MMBtus of natural gas supply for planned use in our East Dubuque Facility in January and February of 2023, respectively, at a weighted average rate per MMBtu of approximately 9.50 and 9.72, respectively, exclusive of transportation costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Marketing and Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "We primarily market UAN products to agricultural customers and ammonia products to agricultural and industrial customers. UAN and ammonia, including freight, accounted for approximately 70% and 24%, respectively, of total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "UAN and ammonia are primarily distributed by truck or railcar. If delivered by truck, products are most commonly sold on a shipping point basis, and freight is normally arranged by the customer. We also utilize a fleet of railcars for use in product delivery. If delivered by railcar, products are most commonly sold on a destination point basis, and we typically arrange the freight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nitrogen fertilizer products leave our Coffeyville Facility either in railcars for destinations located principally on the Union Pacific or Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroads or in trucks for direct shipment to customers. Our East Dubuque Facility primarily sells product to customers located within 200 miles of the facility. In most instances, customers take delivery of nitrogen products at our East Dubuque Facility and arrange to transport them to their final destinations by truck. Additionally, our East Dubuque Facility has direct access to a barge dock on the Mississippi River, as well as a nearby rail spur serviced by the Canadian National Railway Company, both of which are used from time to time to sell and distribute our products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers\n",
    "\n",
    "Retailers and distributors are the main customers for UAN, and, more broadly, the industrial and agricultural sectors are the primary recipients of our ammonia products. Given the nature of our business, and consistent with industry practice, we sell our products on a wholesale basis under a contract or by purchase order. Contracts with customers generally contain fixed pricing and have terms of less than one year. Our top two customers represented 30% and 26% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020, respectively, and our top customer represented 13% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "Nitrogen fertilizer production is a global market with competitors in every region of the world. The industry is dominated by price considerations, which are driven by raw material and transportation costs, currency fluctuations, trade barriers, and regulators. Our business has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, significant levels of competition from domestic and foreign nitrogen fertilizer producers, many of whom have significantly greater financial and other resources. Farming activities intensify in the United States during the spring and fall fertilizer application periods, and geographic proximity to these activities is also a significant competitive advantage for domestic producers. We manage our manufacturing and distribution operations to best serve our customers during these critical periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subject to location and other considerations, our major competitors in the nitrogen fertilizer business generally includes CF Industries Holdings, Inc., which sells significantly more nitrogen fertilizers in the United States than other industry participants; Nutrien Ltd.; Koch Fertilizer Company, LLC; OCI N.V.; and LSB Industries, Inc. Domestic customers generally demonstrate sophisticated buying tendencies that include a focus on cost and service. We also encounter competition from producers of fertilizer products manufactured in foreign countries, including the threat of increased production capacity. In certain cases, foreign producers of fertilizer that export to the United States may be subsidized by their respective governments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonality\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we primarily sell agricultural commodity products, our business is exposed to seasonal fluctuations in demand for nitrogen fertilizer products in the agricultural industry. In addition, the demand for fertilizers is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers who make planting decisions based largely on the prospective profitability of a harvest. The specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like crop prices, farmers’ current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns, and the types of crops planted. We typically experience higher net sales in the first half of the calendar year, which is referred to as the planting season, and net sales tend to be lower during the second half of each calendar year, which is referred to as the fill season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Environmental Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Our business is subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations governing the emission and release of regulated substances into the environment, the transportation, storage, and disposal of waste, the treatment and discharge of wastewater and stormwater, the storage, handling, use, and transportation of our nitrogen fertilizer products, and the characteristics and composition of UAN and ammonia. These laws and regulations and the enforcement thereof impact us by imposing:\n",
    "restrictions on operations or the need to install enhanced or additional control and monitoring equipment;\n",
    "\n",
    "liability for the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at current and former facilities (if any) and for off-site waste disposal locations; and\n",
    "specifications for the products we market, primarily UAN and ammonia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our operations require numerous permits, licenses, and authorizations. Failure to comply with these permits or environmental laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties, or other sanctions or a revocation of our permits, licenses, or authorizations. In addition, the laws and regulations to which we are subject are often evolving and many of them have or could become more stringent or have or could become subject to more stringent interpretation or enforcement by federal or state agencies. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating, and compliance costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Federal Clean Air Act (CAA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAA and its implementing regulations, as well as state laws and regulations governing air emissions, affect us both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts may occur through the CAA’s permitting requirements and/or emission control and monitoring requirements relating to specific air pollutants, as well as the requirement to maintain a risk management program to help prevent accidental releases of certain regulated substances. The CAA affects the Partnership by extensively regulating the air emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and other substances. Some or all of the regulations promulgated pursuant to the CAA, or any future promulgations of regulations, may require the installation of controls or changes to our nitrogen fertilizer facilities (collectively referred to as the Facilities) to maintain compliance. If new controls or changes to operations are needed, the costs could be material.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regulation of air emissions under the CAA requires that we obtain various construction and operating permits and incur capital expenditures for the installation of certain air pollution control devices at our operations. Various standards and programs specific to our operations have been implemented, such as the National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants, the New Source Performance Standards, and the New Source Review.\n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) regulates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under the CAA. In October 2009, the EPA finalized a rule requiring certain large emitters of GHGs to inventory and report their GHG emissions to the EPA. In accordance with the rule, our Facilities monitor and report our GHG emissions to the EPA. In May 2010, the EPA finalized the Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, which established GHG emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources, such as the nitrogen fertilizer facilities, must obtain permits under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V programs of the CAA. Under the rule, facilities already subject to the PSD and Title V programs that increase their emissions of GHGs by a significant amount are required to undergo PSD review and to evaluate and implement air pollution control technology, known as best available control technology, to reduce GHG emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Biden Administration has signaled that it will pursue regulations intended to address climate change. On January 20, 2021, the White House issued its Executive Order titled Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis, as well as a formal notification re-accepting entry of the United States into the Paris Agreement. On January 27, 2021, the White House issued another climate-related Executive Order, titled Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad. On April 22, 2021, the Biden Administration announced a new target for the United States to achieve a 50% to 52% reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net GHG emissions in 2030.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EPA’s approach to regulating GHG emissions may change, including under future administrations. Therefore, the impact on our Facilities due to GHG regulation is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent Greenhouse Gas Footprint Reduction Efforts\n",
    "\n",
    "In October 2020, the Partnership announced that it generated its first carbon offset credits from voluntary nitrous oxide abatement at its Coffeyville Facility. The Partnership has similar nitrous oxide abatement efforts at its East Dubuque Facility. According to the EPA, nitrous oxide represents approximately 7% of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) emissions in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Partnership previously entered into a Joint Development Agreement with ClimeCo, a developer of emission-reduction projects for nitric acid plants, to jointly design, install and operate a tertiary abatement system at one of its nitric acid plants in Coffeyville. The system was designed to abate 94% of all N2O in the unit while preventing the release of approximately 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent on an annualized basis. The N2O abatement systems at the East Dubuque Facility’s two nitric acid plants have abated, on average, the annual release of approximately 265,000 metric tons of CO2e during the past five years.\n",
    "\n",
    "CVR Partners’ N2O abatement projects are registered with the Climate Action Reserve (the Reserve), a carbon offset registry for the North American market. The Reserve employs high-quality standards and an independent third-party verification process to issue its carbon credits, known as Climate Reserve Tonnes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Partnership also sequesters carbon dioxide that is not utilized for urea production at its Coffeyville Facility by capturing and purifying the CO2 as part of its manufacturing process and then transfers it to CapturePoint LLC, an unaffiliated third-party (CapturePoint), which then compresses and ships the CO2 for sequestration through Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). We believe that certain carbon oxide capture and sequestration activities conducted at or in connection with the Coffeyville Facility qualify under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) safe harbor described in Revenue Procedure 2020-12 for certain tax credits available to joint ventures under Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Section 45Q Credits). In January 2023, we entered into a series of agreements with CapturePoint and certain unaffiliated third-party investors intended to qualify under the Internal Revenue Service safe harbor described in Revenue Procedure 2020-12 for certain joint ventures that are eligible to claim Section 45Q Credits and allow us to monetize Section 45Q Credits we expect to generate from January 6, 2023 until March 31, 2030. In January 2023, we received an initial upfront payment, net of expenses, of approximately 18.1 million and could receive up to an additional 60 million in payments through March 31, 2030, if certain carbon oxide capture and sequestration milestones are met, subject to the terms of the applicable agreements. The foregoing summaries of the agreements do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the relevant agreements, which will be filed with the Partnership’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining our nitrous oxide abatement and CO2 sequestration activities should reduce our CO2e footprint by an average of over 1 million metric tons per year. In addition, our Coffeyville Facility is uniquely qualified to produce hydrogen and ammonia that could be certified blue to a market that is increasingly demanding reduced carbon footprints. These greenhouse gas footprint reduction efforts support our core Values of Environment and Continuous Improvement and our goal of continuing to produce nitrogen fertilizers that produce crops that help to feed the world’s growing population in the most environmentally responsible way possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Federal Clean Water Act (CWA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The CWA and its implementing regulations, as well as state laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the water, affect the Partnership. The CWA’s permitting requirements establish discharge limitations that may be based on technology standards, water quality standards, and restrictions on the total maximum daily load of pollutants allowed to enter a particular water body based on its use. In addition, water resources are becoming more scarce. The Coffeyville Facility has contracts in place to receive water during certain water shortage conditions, but these conditions could change over time depending on the scarcity of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "In January 2021, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) announced that is undertaking a plan to review, and update effluent standards for many industries. EPA is prioritizing those sectors that are ranked high in point source categories for total nitrogen discharges, including fertilizer manufacturers. The EPA's review eventually could result in different regulations governing the Partnership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The release of hazardous substances or extremely hazardous substances into the environment is subject to release reporting requirements under federal and state environmental laws. Our Facilities also periodically experience releases of hazardous and extremely hazardous substances from their equipment. From time to time, the EPA has conducted inspections and issued information requests to us with respect to our compliance with reporting requirements under the CERCLA and the EPCRA. If we fail to timely or properly report a release, or if a release violates the law or our permits, we could become the subject of a governmental enforcement action or third-party claims. Government enforcement or third-party claims relating to releases of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances could result in significant expenditures and liability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Environmental Remediation\n",
    "\n",
    "As is the case with all companies engaged in similar industries, we face potential exposure from claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters, including soil and water contamination and personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances that we manufactured, handled, used, stored, transported, spilled, disposed of, or released. The Coffeyville Facility has entered into an agreement with the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) to address certain historical releases of UAN located on our property and comingled with legacy groundwater contamination from the adjacent Coffeyville Resources Refining Marketing, LLC (CRRM) refinery. The cleanup provisions of our agreement with KDHE are held in abeyance so long as CRRM conducts corrective action for these comingled historical releases in accordance with its Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Permit. There is no assurance that CRRM will comply with its Permit conditions in the future, which may trigger enforcement of the cleanup provisions of our agreement with KDHE. There is no assurance that we will not become involved in future proceedings related to the release of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances for which we have potential liability or that, if we were held responsible for damages in any existing or future proceedings, such costs would be covered by insurance or would not be material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Environmental Insurance\n",

    "Risks Related to Our Business\n",
    "\n",
    "Our business is, and nitrogen fertilizer prices are, cyclical and highly volatile, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Demand for nitrogen fertilizer products is dependent on fluctuating demand for crop nutrients by the global agricultural industry. These fluctuations historically have had and could in the future have significant effects on prices across all nitrogen fertilizer products and, in turn, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Nitrogen fertilizer products are commodities, the price of which can be highly volatile. The prices of nitrogen fertilizer products depend on a number of factors, including general economic conditions, cyclical trends in end-user markets, supply and demand imbalances, governmental policies, and weather conditions, which have a greater relevance because of the seasonal nature of fertilizer application. If seasonal demand exceeds the projections on which we base our production levels, customers may acquire nitrogen fertilizer products from competitors, and our profitability may be negatively impacted. If seasonal demand is less than expected, we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored or liquidated. The international market for nitrogen fertilizers is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the U.S. dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing nitrogen fertilizers, foreign agricultural policies, the existence of, or changes in, import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets, changes in the hard currency demands of certain countries and other regulatory policies of foreign governments, as well as the laws and policies of the U.S. affecting foreign trade and investment. Supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates, raw material costs, government policies and global trade. A decrease in nitrogen fertilizer prices would have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow and ability to make distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nitrogen fertilizer products and our business face intense competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our business is subject to intense price competition from both U.S. and foreign sources. With little or no product differentiation, customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and availability of the product. Increased global supply or decreases in transportation costs for foreign sources of fertilizer may put downward pressure on fertilizer prices. We compete with a number of U.S. producers and producers in other countries, including state-owned and government-subsidized entities that may have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales, which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities. In addition, imports of fertilizer from other countries may be unfairly subsidized, as was found to be the case on November 30, 2021 by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the USDOC) with respect to UAN imports from Russia and Trinidad. An inability to compete successfully could result in a loss of customers, which could adversely affect our sales, profitability, and cash flows and, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamic pricing environment for nitrogen fertilizer products, as well as any changes to government policy regarding fertilizer pricing in response thereto, could negatively affect our results of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of the recent strong pricing environment, farmers may shift preference to other types of fertilizer products or shift crop rotation to minimize purchases of nitrogen fertilizer, both of which would negatively affect our sales volumes and revenue. Recent calls for governmental action related to fertilizer pricing conditions, including related to an investigation of market manipulation and proposals to limit price increases or place a maximum price ceiling or cap on fertilizer product pricing, would add complexity to the already dynamic global market for nitrogen fertilizer, and if such initiatives were adopted, our product sales, business and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\"\"\"\n",

    "Our mission is to provide clean energy to feed and fuel the world sustainably. With our employees focused on safe and reliable operations, environmental stewardship, and disciplined capital and corporate management, we are on a path to decarbonize our ammonia production network the world’s largest to enable green and blue hydrogen and nitrogen products for energy, fertilizer, emissions abatement and other industrial activities. Our nitrogen manufacturing complexes in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, an extensive storage, transportation and distribution network in North America, and logistics capabilities enabling a global reach underpin our strategy to leverage our unique capabilities to accelerate the world’s transition to clean energy. Our principal customers are cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, traders, wholesalers and industrial users. Our core product is anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), which contains 82 nitrogen and 18 hydrogen. Our nitrogen products that are upgraded from ammonia are granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN) and ammonium nitrate (AN). Our other nitrogen products include diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), urea liquor, nitric acid and aqua ammonia, which are sold primarily to our industrial customers.  \n",

    "Our Commitment to a Clean Energy Economy  \n",
    "We are taking significant steps to support a global hydrogen and clean fuel economy, through the production of green and blue ammonia. Since ammonia is one of the most efficient ways to transport and store hydrogen and is also a fuel in its own right, we believe that the Company, as the world’s largest producer of ammonia, with an unparalleled manufacturing and distribution network and deep technical expertise, is uniquely positioned to fulfill anticipated demand for hydrogen and ammonia from green and blue sources. Our approach includes green ammonia production, which refers to ammonia produced through a carbon-free process, and blue ammonia production, which relates to ammonia produced by conventional processes but with CO2 byproduct removed through carbon capture and sequestration (CCS).  \n",
    "In April 2021, we signed an engineering and procurement contract with thyssenkrupp to supply a 20 MW alkaline water electrolysis plant to produce green hydrogen at our Donaldsonville complex. Construction and installation, which is being managed by us, is expected to finish in 2023, with an estimated total cost of approximately 100 million. We will integrate the green hydrogen generated by the electrolysis plant into existing ammonia synthesis loops to enable the production of approximately 20,000 tons per year of green ammonia. We believe that the Donaldsonville green ammonia project will be the largest of its kind in North America.  \n",
    "In July 2022, we and Mitsui Co., Ltd. (Mitsui) signed a joint development agreement for the companies proposed plans to construct an export-oriented blue ammonia facility. We and Mitsui continue to progress a front-end engineering and design (FEED) study for the project, and expect to make a final investment decision on the proposed facility in the second half of 2023. Should the companies agree to move forward, the ammonia facility would be constructed at our new Blue Point complex. We acquired the land on the west bank of the Mississippi river in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, for the complex during the third quarter of 2022. Construction and commissioning of a new world-scale ammonia plant typically takes approximately four years from the time construction begins.  \n",
    "We are also exploring opportunities to produce blue ammonia from our existing ammonia production network. We have announced a project with an estimated cost of 200 million to construct a CO2 dehydration and compression facility at our Donaldsonville complex to enable the transport and permanent sequestration of the ammonia process CO2 byproduct. Engineering activities and procurement of major equipment for the facility are in progress, and modification of the site’s existing equipment to allow integration with existing operations has begun. Once the dehydration and compression unit is in service and sequestration is initiated, we expect that the Donaldsonville complex will have the capacity to dehydrate and compress up to 2 million tons per year of CO2, enabling the production of blue ammonia. In October 2022, we announced that we had entered into a definitive CO2 offtake agreement with ExxonMobil to transport and permanently sequester the CO2 from Donaldsonville. Start-up for the project is scheduled for early 2025. Under current regulations, the project would be expected to qualify for tax credits under Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides a credit per tonne of CO2 sequestered.  \n",
    "Company History  \n",
    "We were founded in 1946 as Central Farmers Fertilizer Company, and were owned by a group of regional agriculture cooperatives for the first 59 years of our existence. Central Farmers became CF Industries in 1970.  \n",
    "Originally established as a fertilizer brokerage company, we expanded owning and operating fertilizer manufacturing and distribution facilities in the early 1950s with a principal objective of assured supply for our owners. At various times in our history, we manufactured and/or distributed nitrogen, phosphate and potash fertilizers.  \n",
    "We operated as a traditional manufacturing and supply cooperative until 2002, when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective, rather than assured supply for our owners. A critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace.  \n",
    "In August 2005, we completed the initial public offering (IPO) of our common stock, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In connection with the IPO, we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our pre-IPO owners equity interests in CF Industries were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and shares of our common stock. At the time of the IPO, our assets consisted of one wholly owned nitrogen manufacturing facility in Louisiana, United States; a joint venture nitrogen manufacturing facility in Alberta, Canada, of which we owned 66 percent; a phosphate mining and manufacturing operation in Florida, United States; and distribution facilities throughout North America.  \n",
    "In April 2010, we acquired Terra Industries Inc. (Terra), a leading North American producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products for a purchase price of 4.6 billion, which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock. As a result of the Terra acquisition, we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities; an approximately 75.3 interest in Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. (TNCLP), a publicly traded limited partnership; and certain joint venture interests.  \n",
    "Prior to April 30, 2013, CF Industries owned 66 percent of Canadian Fertilizers Limited (CFL), a joint venture nitrogen manufacturing facility in Alberta, Canada. On April 30, 2013, CF Industries acquired all of the outstanding interests in CFL that it did not already own and CFL became our wholly owned subsidiary.  \n",
    "In March 2014, we exited our phosphate mining and manufacturing business, which was located in Florida, through a sale to The Mosaic Company. As a result, we became focused solely on nitrogen manufacturing and distribution.  \n",
    "In July 2015, we acquired the remaining 50 equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK Group Limited (formerly known as GrowHow UK Group Limited) (CF Fertilisers UK) not previously owned by us, and CF Fertilisers UK became wholly owned by us. This transaction added CF Fertilisers UK’s nitrogen manufacturing complexes to our consolidated manufacturing capacity.  \n",
    "In February 2016, our strategic venture with CHS commenced, at which time CHS made a capital contribution of 2.8 billion to CFN in exchange for membership interests in CFN, which represented approximately 11 of the total membership interests of CFN.  \n",
    "In late 2015 and 2016, we completed capacity expansion projects at our Donaldsonville complex in Louisiana and our Port Neal complex in Iowa. These projects, originally announced in 2012, included the construction of new ammonia, urea, and UAN plants at our Donaldsonville complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our Port Neal complex. These plants increased our overall production capacity by approximately 25, improved our product mix flexibility at Donaldsonville, and improved our ability to serve upper-Midwest urea customers from our Port Neal location. The total capital cost of the capacity expansion projects was 5.2 billion.  \n",
    "Prior to April 2, 2018, Terra Nitrogen, Limited Partnership, which owns and operates our Verdigris nitrogen manufacturing facility in Oklahoma, was a subsidiary of TNCLP. On April 2, 2018, Terra Nitrogen GP Inc., the sole general partner of TNCLP and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CF Holdings, completed its purchase of all of the publicly traded common units of TNCLP (the Purchase). Upon completion of the Purchase, CF Holdings owned, through its subsidiaries, 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of TNCLP.  \n",

This facility has the capacity to produce 720,000 tons of ammonia annually from natural gas supplied under a contract with The National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC).  \n",
    "Nitrogen Product Raw Materials  \n",
    "Natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at our nitrogen manufacturing facilities. In 2022, natural gas accounted for approximately 50 of our total production costs for nitrogen products. Our nitrogen manufacturing facilities have access to abundant, competitively-priced natural gas through a reliable network of pipelines that are connected to major natural gas trading hubs. Our facilities utilize the following natural gas hubs: Henry Hub, SONAT and TETCO ELA in Louisiana; ONEOK in Oklahoma; AECO in Alberta; Ventura in Iowa; Demarcation in Kansas; Welcome in Minnesota; Dawn and Parkway in Ontario; and the National Balancing Point (NBP) in the United Kingdom.  \n",
    "In 2022, our nitrogen manufacturing facilities consumed, in the aggregate, approximately 330 million MMBtus of natural gas. We employ a combination of daily spot and term purchases from a variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable, competitively-priced supply of natural gas. We also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices. See Note 15 Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information about our natural gas hedging activities.  \n",
    "Nitrogen Product Distribution  \n",
    "The safe, efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen products is critical for successful operations. Our nitrogen production facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship products to terminals, warehouses and customers. Each of our production facilities has a unique distribution pattern based on its production capacity and location.  \n",
    "Our North American nitrogen production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and to our storage facilities in the U.S. and Canada, with access to our leased railcar fleet of approximately 5,000 tank and hopper cars, as well as railcars provided by rail carriers. Our United Kingdom nitrogen production facility mainly ships products via truck.  \n",
    "The North American waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our Donaldsonville, Verdigris and Yazoo City facilities. To ship ammonia and UAN, we employ a fleet of up to eleven tow boats and thirty-six river barges, which are primarily leased. We also utilize contract marine services to move granular urea and AN. We can also export nitrogen products via seagoing vessels from our Donaldsonville and Billingham manufacturing facilities.  \n",
    "The Donaldsonville facility is connected to the 2,000-mile long Nustar pipeline through which we have the ability to transport ammonia to ten terminals and shipping points in the Midwestern U.S. corn belt.  \n",
    "Storage Facilities and Other Properties  \n",
    "As of December 31, 2022, we owned or leased space at 50 in-market storage terminals and warehouses located in a 21-state region of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.

    "(2) The owned facilities that store UAN also can store ammonia.  \n",
    "(3) Our lease agreements are typically for periods of one to five years and commonly contain provisions for automatic renewal that can extend the lease term unless cancelled by either party.  \n",
    "Customers  \n",
    "The principal customers for our nitrogen products are cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, traders, wholesalers and industrial users. Sales are generated by our internal marketing and sales force. CHS was our largest customer in 2022 and accounted for approximately 13 of our consolidated net sales. We have a strategic venture with CHS under which CHS has a minority equity interest in CFN. See Note 17 Noncontrolling Interest for additional information on our strategic venture with CHS.  \n",
    "Competition  \n",
    "Our markets are global and intensely competitive, based primarily on delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on customer service and product quality. During the peak demand periods, product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers.  \n",
    "Our primary North American-based competitors include Nutrien Ltd., Koch Fertilizer LLC, N-7 LLC (a joint venture between OCI N.V. and Dakota Gasification Company) and Yara International. There is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world, including some with lower natural gas or other feedstock costs, which may include the benefit of government subsidies. Because ammonia, urea and UAN are widely-traded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to entry, we experience competition from foreign-sourced products continuously. Producers of nitrogen-based fertilizers located in the Middle East, Trinidad, North Africa and Russia have been major exporters to North America in recent years.  \n",
    "Our primary United Kingdom competition comes from imported products supplied by companies including Yara International, Origin Fertilisers, Ameropa and Thomas Bell Sons Ltd. Urea and UAN are not produced in the United Kingdom, but along with AN are widely-traded fertilizer products with limited barriers to entry.  \n",
    "Seasonality  \n",
    "The fertilizer business is seasonal. The degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to weather conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors. The strongest demand for our products in North America occurs during the spring planting season, with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest. In contrast, we and other fertilizer producers generally manufacture and distribute products throughout the year. As a result, we and/or our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons. Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product. The seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather-related shifts in planting and application schedules and purchasing patterns as well as import timing, import and distribution costs and logistical limitations, such as river conditions.  \n",
    "Environmental, Health and Safety  \n",
    "We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union (EU) and Trinidad, including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes; the introduction of new chemicals or substances into a market; the cleanup of hazardous substance releases; the discharge of regulated substances to air or water; and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure. In the United States, these laws include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and various other federal, state and local statutes. Violations of environmental, health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties, court orders to install pollution-control equipment, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. In addition, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment. We may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental, health and safety laws in the future.  \n",
    "Environmental, Health and Safety Expenditures  \n",
    "Our environmental, health and safety capital expenditures in 2022 totaled approximately 31 million. We estimate that we will have approximately 57 million of environmental, health and safety capital expenditures in 2023. In addition, to support safe and reliable operations at our continuous process manufacturing facilities, we conduct scheduled inspections, replacements and overhauls of our plant machinery and equipment, which are referred to as turnarounds. A further description of turnaround activities is included in Note 6 Property, Plant and Equipment Net in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our manufacturing and distribution facilities. Such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures. Our costs to comply with, or any liabilities under, these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  \n",
    "CERCLA/Remediation Matters  \n",
    "From time to time, we receive notices from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party at certain cleanup sites under CERCLA or other environmental cleanup laws. In 2011, we received a notice from the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ) that alleged that we were a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of a former phosphate mine site we owned in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in Georgetown Canyon, Idaho. The current owner of the property and a former mining contractor received similar notices for the site. In 2014, we and the current property owner entered into a Consent Order with IDEQ and the U.S. Forest Service to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study of the site. The remedial investigation was submitted to the agencies in 2021. The next step will be a risk assessment, followed by a feasibility study. In 2015, we and several other parties received a notice that the U.S. Department of the Interior and other trustees intended to undertake a natural resource damage assessment for 18 former phosphate mines and three former processing facilities in southeast Idaho, which includes the Georgetown Canyon former mine and processing facility. See Note 20 Contingencies for additional information.  \n",
    "Regulation of Greenhouse Gases  \n",
    "Our production facilities emit greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Natural gas, a fossil fuel, is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process. We are subject to GHG regulations in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States.  \n",
    "Our U.K. manufacturing plant is required to report GHG emissions annually to the United Kingdom Environment Agency pursuant to its site Environmental Permits and Climate Change Agreement, which specifies energy efficiency targets. Failure to meet efficiency targets may require the plant to purchase CO2 emissions allowances. Our U.K. manufacturing plant is subject to the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS), which generally requires us to hold or obtain emission allowances to offset GHG emissions from those aspects of our operations that are subject to regulation under this program.  \n",
    "In Canada, we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with Environment Canada’s National Pollutant Release Inventory, Ontario’s Mandatory Monitoring and Reporting Regulation, and the GHG Reporting Regulation. In addition, our manufacturing plants in Alberta and Ontario are subject to provincial or federal laws that impose a price on excess GHG emissions. Each of these laws establishes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions standards applicable to our facilities in terms of emissions per unit of production, with the provincial laws and the federal law using different formulas for establishing the intensity-based limits and the reductions in these limits over time. The federal law is the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, which came into effect in 2018 and is intended to function only as a backstop to the provincial programs if such programs do not meet minimum federal criteria. In 2022, the federal government found that both the Alberta and Ontario programs for 2023-2030 met such minimum criteria, and therefore, the provincial laws apply. Effective January 1, 2023, these provincial regulations will increase in stringency from 2022 levels. If a facility’s CO2e emissions exceed the applicable limit, the excess emissions must be offset, either through obtaining qualifying emission credits or by making a payment for each ton of excess emissions. For calendar year 2023, the excess emissions fee under the federal, Alberta, and Ontario regulatory programs is CAD 65 per tonne, which fee will increase by CAD 15 per tonne per year, reaching CAD 170 per tonne by 2030.  \n",
    "In the United States, GHG regulation is evolving at state, regional, and federal levels, although some of the more significant developments to date, including efforts of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants, do not directly impose obligations on our facilities. The EPA issued a mandatory GHG reporting rule that required all of our U.S. manufacturing facilities, which are considered large emitters of GHGs, to commence monitoring GHG emissions beginning on January 1, 2010 and reporting the previous year’s emissions annually starting in 2011. In addition, if we seek to modify or expand any of our major facilities and as a result, are required to obtain a Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) construction permit applicable to such facilities, we could be subject to pollution control requirements applicable to GHGs in addition to requirements applicable to conventional air pollutants. Such requirements may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects. Other than the states implementation of this permitting requirement, none of the states where our U.S. production facilities are located Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma has proposed control regulations limiting GHG emissions.  \n",
    "Increasing concern over the impacts of climate change is driving countries to establish ever more ambitious GHG reduction targets. Approximately 200 countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the members of the EU have joined the Paris Agreement, an international agreement intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2 C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels. Each signatory is required to develop its own national plan to attain this objective. In December 2020, the United Kingdom announced a target to reduce GHG emissions 68 from the baseline year of 1990 by 2030. Canada has increased its emissions reduction target under the Paris Agreement to 40-45 below 2005 levels by 2030, up from 30 . In April 2021, the United States increased its goal to reduce GHG emissions to 50-52 below 2005 levels by 2030. Executive orders issued by the Biden administration, including in particular an executive order issued on January 27, 2021 focusing on climate change, evidence the administration’s intent to undertake numerous initiatives in an effort to reduce GHG emissions, including promoting renewable energy development, limiting new oil and gas leases on federal lands and, in general, making climate change considerations a critical component of federal policy.  \n",
    "Regulatory Permits and Approvals  \n",
    "We hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility. Any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals. More stringent environmental standards may impact our ability to obtain such permits.  \n",
